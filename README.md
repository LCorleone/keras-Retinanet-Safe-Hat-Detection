## Requirements
please see the original github [keras-retinanet](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet)  

## Notes
* Sorry I can not provide the training dataset, so only the trained model is available.
* The safe hat seems to be relatively small, by now I didn't figure out how to modify the anchor settings correctly in keras-retinanet. Indeed I try but the performance is not satisfactory. If anyone know about this, feel free to contact me!
* The trained model is available here [BAIDU PAN](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1EkiJhNivu9Pjdr350kM6UA)
